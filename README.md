## ❓ Questions

- Can you find out where the error happened?
- Can you explain why the code failed now, but not before?
- What would be the options to fix it?
- Do you have any other thoughts on this code?

##  📃 Answers

### 1️⃣ Can you find out where the error happened? Can you explain why the code failed now, but not before?

→ The error happened inside the method `next_display_name` of the class `User::DisplayNameBuilder`. By using the first name and the first letter of the last name, the code generates a display name for the user. Whenever it finds a user with a similar display name, it adds a number and increases it until it finds an available name. The problem is that many similar users have the same display_name `klaus_m` + number. Because of that, the code tries to increase the last number until 999, and when it reaches that number, it raises the error `StandardError: cannot generate a display_name for this user`. Here is the line of code where it occurs:

```ruby
@counter >= 999 and raise 'cannot generate a display_name for this user'
```

### 2️⃣ What would be the options to fix it?

→ One of the options to fix this problem would be to change the instance counter variable to

```ruby
@counter = User.where("display_name LIKE ?", "#{@base_display_name}%").count
```

→ As a result, we can now determine how many `display_name`s share the same `base_display_name`. Next, we can change the `next_display_name` method to:

```ruby
class User::DisplayNameBuilder
  # [...]

  def next_display_name
    display_name = base_display_name.first(17)
    display_name = "#{display_name}#{@counter}" unless @counter.zero? # When the counter is no longer zero, the counter number is added to the end of the display_name variable.
    return display_name if display_name_available?(display_name)
    
    generate_token(10)
  end

  # [...]
end
```

→ When `display_name` is somehow unavailable, we return the `generated_token` to guarantee that at least it will give the user a display name. As the user cannot control this generation, **raising an error, in this case, would only frustrate the user.** 😓

→ Due to those changes, we should also change the tests and add some new ones.

### 💭 Alternatives?

→ Another option to solve this problem is to **increase the maximum counter number**, but I am certain that this **will not scale well** since it will eventually reach the max counter limit for some `display_name` and raise the error again.

→ We could also use the user id instead of the counter variable, but this would put at risk existing `display_name`s that might conflict and **would require extra work for the moment.** In the case of an auto-incremented integer ID, it would also reveal the number of users we have, which may not be desirable.


### 3️⃣ Thoughts on the code

→ There are some things that we can improve.

3.1. On `assign_display_name!`, we can move the early return condition to the callback call in the `User` model, avoiding initializing the class.

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  # [...]
  before_create { DisplayNameBuilder.new(self).assign_display_name! unless display_name.present? }
  # [...]
end

# app/models/user/display_name_builder.rb

class User::DisplayNameBuilder
# [...]
  def assign_display_name!
    # @user.display_name.present? and return
    @user.display_name = next_display_name
  end
# [...]
end
```

3.2. On the `generate_base_display_name` method, if the `first_name` and `last_name` are blank, we can do an early return with the token, as expected.

```ruby
# app/models/user/display_name_builder.rb

class User::DisplayNameBuilder
# [...]
  def generate_base_display_name(user)
    return generate_token(10) if full_name_blank?(user)

    base = escape(user.first_name.to_s[/\A\s*(\S+)/, 1])
    first_last_name_character(user).full? { |char| base << "_#{char}" }
    # PS: I could not understand where .full? method comes from, and what it exactly does.

    base.full?(:first, 20) || generate_token(10)
  end

  def full_name_blank?(user)
    user.first_name.blank? && user.last_name.blank?
  end
# [...]
end
```

3.3. It is possible to make some methods private, based on what we really need to expose from this class.

3.4. EXTRA: we could also add `validate_uniqueness_of :display_name` to the user model if we wish to achieve that. To accomplish this, we need to change the callback call in the model file to `before_validation :build_display_name, on: :create`.

3.5. EXTRA: the method `generate_token` is not used outside the class, according to the shown files. This indicates that it should be refactored if not used anywhere else, as the default `size` variable and the `block` variable are unused.

## ✨ The final code

→ As a result of these changes, the final code would look as follows:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  # [...]
  before_create { DisplayNameBuilder.new(self).assign_display_name! unless display_name.present? }
  # [...]
end

# app/models/user/display_name_builder.rb

class User::DisplayNameBuilder
  attr_accessor :base_display_name

  def initialize(user)
    @user = user
    @base_display_name = generate_base_display_name(user)
    @counter = User.where("display_name LIKE ?", "#{@base_display_name}%").count
  end

  def assign_display_name!
    @user.display_name = next_display_name
  end

  private 
  
  def generate_base_display_name(user)
    return generate_token(10) if full_name_blank?(user)

    base = escape(user.first_name.to_s[/\A\s*(\S+)/, 1]) # Ignore leading spaces and fetch the first non-ws token
    first_last_name_character(user).full? { |char| base << "_#{char}" }

    base.full?(:first, 20) || generate_token(10)
  end

  def full_name_blank?(user)
    user.first_name.blank? && user.last_name.blank?
  end

  def escape(str)
    s = I18n.transliterate str.to_s
    s.gsub!(/[^a-z]+/i, '') # remove all non-word characters after transliteration
    s.downcase!
    s
  end

  def first_last_name_character(user)
    escape(user.last_name).first(1)
  end
  
  def next_display_name
    display_name = base_display_name.first(17)
    display_name = "#{display_name}#{@counter}" unless @counter.zero?
    return display_name if display_name_available?(display_name)
    
    generate_token(10)
  end
  
  def display_name_available?(display_name)
    !User.exists?(display_name: display_name)
  end

  def generate_token(size = 64, &block)
    block ||= ->* { true }
    loop do
      token = Tins::Token.new(
        length: size,
        alphabet: Tins::Token::BASE64_URL_FILENAME_SAFE_ALPHABET,
      )
      return token if block.call(token)
    end
  end
end
```
